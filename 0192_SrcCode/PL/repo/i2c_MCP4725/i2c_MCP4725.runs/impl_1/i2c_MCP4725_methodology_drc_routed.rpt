LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell cnt[7]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) clk_100k_reg_reg/CLR, clk_count_reg[0]/CLR, clk_count_reg[1]/CLR, clk_count_reg[2]/CLR, clk_count_reg[3]/CLR, clk_count_reg[4]/CLR, clk_count_reg[5]/CLR, clk_count_reg[6]/CLR, clk_count_reg[7]/CLR, cnt_reg[0]/CLR, cnt_reg[1]/CLR, cnt_reg[2]/CLR, cnt_reg[3]/CLR, cnt_reg[4]/CLR, cnt_reg[5]/CLR (the first 15 of 20 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
